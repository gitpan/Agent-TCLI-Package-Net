USING

Passive Agents:
One creates a script, see agent_net.pl, that loads up a TCLI transport with
users, packages and other pertinent information. The agent will log in, join
chatrooms if in the user list, and wait for further commands from authorized
users or in a chatroom.

Test script:
A test script is written, see ex/probe.pl, that loads up a Test Transport,
other necessary transports, necessary local packages, and testees.

Using testees, one creates tests ala Test::More with the $testee->ok or
$testee->like_body and other Testee tests. These will run asynchronously
after the testing starts.

It is necessary to call the test_master->run at the end of the test script
to ensure that all tests have completed.
