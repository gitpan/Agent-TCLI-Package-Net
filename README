Agent::TCLI::Package::Net version 0.0.1

This suite allows one to run tests for Network Security device functionality.

INSTALLATION

Currently this is still alpha. I've only been running it out of blib
(see example sources). The ./Build install has not been tested,
though there is no known reason why it would not work.

Install with Module::Build, using the following commands in the directory
that this package unipped into:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

Of course the Agent::TCLI::Core. You'll alsoe need:

	POE::Component::Client::Ping
	POE::Component::Client::Traceroute
	POE::Component::Client::HTTP

USING

Passive Bots:
One creates a script, see or ex/net.pl, that loads up a TCLI transport with
users, packages and other pertinent information. The bot will log in, join
chatrooms if in the user list, and wait for further commands from authorized
users or in a chatroom.

Test script:
A test script is written, see ex/probe.pl, that loads up a Test Transport,
other necessary transports, necessary local packages, and testees.

Using testees, one creates tests ala Test::More with the $testee->ok or
$testee->like_body and other Testee tests. These may wil asynchronously
after the testing starts.

It is necessary to call the test_master->run at the end of the test script
to ensure that all tests have completed.
