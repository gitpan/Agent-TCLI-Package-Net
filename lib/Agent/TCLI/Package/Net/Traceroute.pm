=head1 NAME

Agent::TCLI::Package::Net::Traceroute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From within a TCLI Agent session:

traceroute example.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a package of commands for the TCLI environment. Currently
one must use the TCLI environment (or browse the source) to see documentation
for the commands it supports within the TCLI Agent.

Makes a standard traceroute request.

=head1 INTERFACE

This module must be loaded into a Agent::TCLI::Control by an
Agent::TCLI::Transport in order for a user to interface with it.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes are accessible through standard <attribute>
methods unless otherwise noted.

These attrbiutes are generally internal and are probably only useful to
someone trying to enhance the functionality of this Package module.

Some attributes may be created through the loading of the Parameters for this
command package. These are not documented separately. See the source for the
exact attribute names in use.

=head2 METHODS

Most of these methods are for internal use within the TCLI system and may
be of interest only to developers trying to enhance TCLI.

=item new ( hash of attributes )

Usually the only attributes that are useful on creation are the
verbose and do_verbose attrbiutes that are inherited from Agent::TCLI::Base.

Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: firsthop
  constraints:
    - UINT
  default: 1
  help: Set the first hop.
  manual: >
    Firsthop sets the starting TTL value for the traceroute. firsthop
    defaults to 1 and can not be set higher than 255 or greater than max_ttl.

  class: numeric
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: max_ttl
  constraints:
    - UINT
  default: 30
  help: Set the maximum TTL.
  manual: >
    Maxttl sets the maximum TTL for the traceroute. Once this many hops
    have been attempted, if the target has still not been reached, the
    traceroute finishes and a 'MaxTTL exceeded without reaching target'
    error is returned along with all of the data collected. max_ttl
    defaults to 32 and can not be set higher than 255.
  type: Param
  class: numeric
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: timeout
  constraints:
    - UINT
  default: 0
  help: Set global timeout in seconds.
  manual: >
    Timeout sets the maximum time any given traceroute will run. After
    this time the traceroute will stop in the middle of where ever it
    is and a 'Traceroute session timeout' error is returned along with
    all of the data collected. Timeout defaults to 0, which disables
    it completely.

Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: querytimeout
  constraints:
    - UINT
  default: 3
  help: Set timeout for each query in seconds.
  manual: >
    Querytimeout sets the maximum before an individual query times out.
    If the query times out an * is set for the response time and the
    router IP address in the results data.
    QueryTtimeout defaults to 3 seconds.
  type: Param
  class: numeric
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: queries
  constraints:
    - UINT
  default: 3
  help: Set number of queries per hop.
  manual: >
    Queries sets the number of queries (packets) for each hop to send.
    The response time for each query is recorded in the results table.
    The higher this is, the better the chance of getting a response
    from a flaky device, but the longer a traceroute takes to run.
    Queries defaults to 3.

      - 65279
  default: 33434
  help: The starting port for udp traces.
  manual: >
    Baseport sets the first port used for traceroute when not using ICMP.
    The baseport is incremented by one for each hop, by traceroute
    convention. BasePort defaults to 33434 and can not be higher than 65279.
  type: Param
  class: numeric
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: useicmp
  constraints:
    - UINT
  help: Turns on icmp instead of udp.
  manual: >
    Useicmp causes the traceroute to use ICMP Echo Requests instead of UDP
    packets. This is advantagious in networks where ICMP Unreachables are
    disabled, as ICMP Echo Responses are usually still allowed.
