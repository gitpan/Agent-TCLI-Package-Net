=head1 SYNOPSIS

From within a TCLI Agent session:

tget url=http://example.com/bad_request resp=404

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a package of commands for the TCLI environment. Currently
one must use the TCLI environment (or browse the source) to see documentation
for the commands it supports within the TCLI Agent.

Makes standard http requests, either testing that a response code was given
or receive the response code back.

=head1 INTERFACE

This module must be loaded into a Agent::TCLI::Control by an
Agent::TCLI::Transport in order for a user to interface with it.
