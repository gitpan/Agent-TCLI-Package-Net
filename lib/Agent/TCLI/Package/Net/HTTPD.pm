=head1 NAME

Agent::TCLI::Package::Net:HTTP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From within a TCLI Agent session:

httpd uri add regex=^/good/.* response=OK200

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a package of commands for the TCLI environment. Currently
one must use the TCLI environment (or browse the source) to see documentation
for the commands it supports within the TCLI Agent.

This package starts a specialized HTTPD on the local system. It does not
return files but does return 404 or 200 values for user defined URLs. It can
also be set to completely ignore a request. URLs may be defined with
regular expressions.

It can also log directly to the log being monitored by the Tail command
in memory with no disk writes.

=head1 INTERFACE

This module must be loaded into a Agent::TCLI::Control by an
Agent::TCLI::Transport in order for a user to interface with it.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes are accessible through standard <attribute>
methods unless otherwise noted.

These attrbiutes are generally internal and are probably only useful to
someone trying to enhance the functionality of this Package module.

=over

=item ports

A hash of ports with HTTPD listeners running
B<ports> will only contain hash values.

=cut

my @ports			:Field
					:Type('hash')
					:Arg('name'=>'ports', 'default'=>{ } )
					:Acc('ports');

=item handlers

The array of handlers for the SimpleHTTP server.
B<handlers> will only contain Array values.

=cut
my @handlers		:Field
					:Type('Array')
					:All('handlers');

=back

=head2 METHODS

Most of these methods are for internal use within the TCLI system and may
be of interest only to developers trying to enhance TCLI.

=over

=item new ( hash of attributes )

Usually the only attributes that are useful on creation are the
verbose and do_verbose attrbiutes that are inherited from Agent::TCLI::Base.

  help: An address to listen on
  manual: >
    The IP address for the HTTPD to listen on. Must already be configured
    on the system.

    -
      - BETWEEN
      - 1
      - 65535
  default: 8080
  help: A port to listen on
  manual: >
    Port sets the port used for the HTTPD to receive requests on.
    It must not already be in use by another process. If is is less
    than 1024, then the script must already be running as root or
    the HTTPD will fail to start. Port defaults to 8080.
  type: Param
  class: numeric
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: hostname
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: A hostname that the server will respond back with.
  manual: >
    The host nmae is the name the server will respond back with. It
    does not have to be the correct DNS name for the server. It will default
    to Sys::Hostname.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: regex
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: A regular expression pattern
  manual: >
    The regex should be a string that can be evaluated inside a regular
    expression. It should not include the delimeters or be provided in
    qr() form.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: logging
  help: Turn on logging to the Tail command line queue
  manual: >
    The logging switch turns on logging to the line queue monitored by the
    Tail command. This does not write to logs disk. One may then set up
    Tail tests for specific URI's to determine exactly which ones got through.
    To turn off, use no_logging.
    By default the line queue will only hold 10 lines so memory cannot
    accidentally be exhausted.
  type: Switch

  name: response
  aliases: resp
  constraints:

Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: handlers

  manual: >
    httpd provides a simple web server that can respond to and log requests.
    By default it responds with a Status code 404 to all requests. One may add
    a select few other status code responses using regular expression pattern
    matching if desired. One cannot change content, only status codes.
    Httpd is useful for network testing situations where the response codes
    are being monitored by the network.

    Adds a uri regular expression and the desired response to the handler table.
    Regular expressions are applied in order of their entry into the table and
    the first match is the one that wins. One cannot delete the default
    catch-all response, but one can add a different catch-all response in
    front of it using regex=.*

One cannot add uri's while a HTTPD server is running.

SHOULDS and MUSTS are currently not enforced.

Test scripts not thorough enough.

Probably many others.
